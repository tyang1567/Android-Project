## Overview
Android application that is interactive and provides a new, less time-consuming way for users to journal.
### Description
A personal diary/journal that consists of pictures. When the user takes a picture and uses it as a journal entry, the location where the photo was taken is recorded. The user may also add a description of the photo along with the entry.

[Description of your app]

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Personal
- **Mobile:** The app uses the camera and captures the location of the pictures taken, making the photos more memorable.
- **Story:** Creates a memorable journal that users can look back on. Memories are an important factor that make us who we are.
- **Market:** For people that want to start journaling, or like to journal, this could be a very memorable, but not as time-consuming way, this is a new approach that is less time-consuming but just as memorable and stress-relieving. The app could also be very appealing to those who like photography. It would be well-received by people of all ages since photography and journaling is not particularly niche.
- **Habit:** People are using this daily, or multiple times a week to record their day-to-day lives or adventures. 
- **Scope:** It is reasonable for this app to be completed by the end of the program; and there are also
many available APIs to help with the different components of this app.

## Completed user stories
Completed user story (completed implementation, but cannot be shown through an emulator): user can take photos using camera

- User stories to be cut:
  - User can view their previously taken photos (regrettably, cannot be implemented as the camera on the emulator does not work). 

[Add video/gif of your current application that shows build progress]
- At first, the app asked for permission to access the camera, which is how I knew that the application was working correctly, but it is an emulator issue. Now when you click the button, it only displays a
  toast that states that no camera app is available.

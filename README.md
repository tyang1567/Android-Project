### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Personal
- **Mobile:** The app uses the camera and captures the location of the pictures taken, making the photos more memorable.
- **Story:** Creates a memorable journal that users can look back on. Memories are an important factor that make us who we are.
- **Market:** For people that want to start journaling, or like to journal, this could be a very memorable, but not as time-consuming way, this is a new approach that is less time-consuming but just as memorable and stress-relieving. The app could also be very appealing to those who like photography. It would be well-received by people of all ages since photography and journaling is not particularly niche.
- **Habit:** People are using this daily, or multiple times a week to record their day-to-day lives or adventures. 
- **Scope:** It is reasonable for this app to be completed by the end of the program; and there are also
many available APIs to help with the different components of this app.
